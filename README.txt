Title: Encrypt/Decrypt

PLEASE RUN PROGRAM IN VS CODE using the command line input. DO NOT USE A ONLINE GDB or REPLIT, it will not work!

Hello, here is my program written in 'C'.
It can take a non encrypted input file of any type and output an encrypted text file. 
It can also take in an encrypted file as an input of any type and output its decrypted version as a crp file.
Using specific command line function you can use the program in different ways.

Commands:
To Encrypt:

gcc cryptoMagic.c
a.exe -E filename.txt  OR  a.exe filename.txt

To Decrypt:
gcc cryptoMagic.c
a.exe -D filename.crp


**These commands can have any filename, with any extention or without one as well to function.
